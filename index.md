**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic we've covered in my domain is the use of tokenization in AI APIs! It was very interesting seeing how much these tokens cost in real life and how they apply to the average user. I found it very interesting how people optimize interactions with AI, keeping cost and computing power in mind. This was not a usual topic that I considered before participating in my domain this quarter and seeing how tokens work. 

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
A potential investigation I would like to pursue for the Quarter 2 project is how gamification impacts student performance on exams and overall how it affects learning in general. A popular issue/topic of conversation in today's society are peoples' decreasing attention spans and their overall need for immediate stimulation. In order to accomodate for the way people intereact with digital products, I want to explore how gamifying an educational tool positively or negatively impacts the effectivess of said tool.

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
A potential change I'd make to our approach is probably shifting our priorities a bit more towards developing our own unique curriculum. As of the time of writing, our group is "taking inspiration" from courses that revolve around the basics or principles of data science. I think I would enjoy planning a course that is more unique to all of our experiences in the data science major.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I'd be interested in learning swift if our group is up for publishing a mobile app for ios devices. I've always wanted to learn swift but found it to not have that much relevance to the data science curriculum here at UCSD. Most core major courses that involve frontend development are about web dev and not mobile development.
